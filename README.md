# UxntalProject

.................

As you can see, this is an Uxntal project.  
In this repository I'll document an instance of writing UxNTAL and a subsequent actual project to convert it to Web Assembly, which is still under development.

## Here are some pappers/pages about unx and web assembly that I prefer

***For uxntal:***

https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html 
https://github.com/karolbelina/uxntal.vim (I find someone is trying to do the File detection and syntax highlighting for the Uxntal programming language, interesting) 
Unfortunately, it seems that finding papers on UXN/UxnTAL is not a very easy thing 

***For web assembly:***
Data Aware Web-Assembly Function Placemen   https://doi.org/10.1145/3366424.3382670  
Bringing the web up to speed with WebAssembly https://doi.org/10.1145/3062341.3062363
