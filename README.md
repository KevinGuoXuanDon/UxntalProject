# UxntalProject

*** How can I use this project :*** 
This project #has completely completed the conversion of UnXTAL-WASM#, it is very simple to use. 
1. Git pull code 
2. executes it through the #main.class# entry function. 
3. You can also unit test each method using #allTest.java under Package #JunitTest 


.................
  
In this repository I'll document an instance of writing UxNTAL and a subsequent actual project to convert it to Web Assembly, which is still under development.

## Here are some pappers/pages about unx and web assembly that I prefer

***For uxntal :*** 

Official tutorials and instructions   (https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn)

I find someone is trying to do the File detection and syntax highlighting for the Uxntal programming language, interesting  (https://github.com/karolbelina/uxntal.vim) 


*Unfortunately, it seems that finding papers on UXN/UxnTAL is not a very easy thing* 

***For web assembly :***
