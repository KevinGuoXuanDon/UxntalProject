# UxntalProject

*** How can I use this project :*** 
This project *has completely completed the conversion of UnXTAL-WASM*, it is very simple to use. 
1. `Git pull` to copy codes to your local environment.  
2. Executes it through the Entry Class *main.class*. Once you run it, *chooese a .tal file through GUI* and *All information will be printed automatically* and you can find _target file.wat_ acrroding to guide. 
3. You may also Unit Test each method using *allTest.java* under Package _JunitTest_ , you can edit unit test as you with to do variety of unit test.

### Required Environment:
1. Jdk >= 1.8
2. A running IDE: I prefer IDEA, of course you can use eclipse, vscode, etc., all supported

In this repository I'll document an instance of writing UxNTAL and a subsequent actual project to convert it to Web Assembly, which is still under development.

## Here are some pappers/pages about unx and web assembly that I prefer

I find someone is trying to do the File detection and syntax highlighting for the Uxntal programming language, interesting  (https://github.com/karolbelina/uxntal.vim) 


*Unfortunately, it seems that finding papers on UXN/UxnTAL is not a very easy thing* 

***For web assembly :***
