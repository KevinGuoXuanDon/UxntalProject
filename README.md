# UxntalProject

.................

As you can see, this is an Uxntal project.  
In this repository I'll document an instance of writing UxNTAL and a subsequent actual project to convert it to Web Assembly, which is still under development.

## Here are some pappers/pages about unx and web assembly that I prefer

***For uxntal :*** 

Official tutorials and instructions   (https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn) 

wikipedia.  (https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html) 

I find someone is trying to do the File detection and syntax highlighting for the Uxntal programming language, interesting  (https://github.com/karolbelina/uxntal.vim) 


*Unfortunately, it seems that finding papers on UXN/UxnTAL is not a very easy thing* 

***For web assembly :*** 

Data Aware Web-Assembly Function Placemen   (https://doi.org/10.1145/3366424.3382670)  
Bringing the web up to speed with WebAssembly (https://doi.org/10.1145/3062341.3062363)
