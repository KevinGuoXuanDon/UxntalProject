record a small problem
program now cannot deal with nested multi lable
For instance
@test
,&draw-sprite
      &draw-sprite
        ( set  x,y coordinates )
        #0008 .Screen/x DEO2
        #0008 .Screen/y DEO2

        ;square .Screen/addr DEO2
        #01 .Screen/sprite DEO
	BRK
BRK

@test lable mapping will end once it meet the first "BRK"
